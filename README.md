# Tabular Editor Macros (Power BI)

This is a repository of helpful C# scripts for use in Tabular Editor 3. Developed by Matt Hecht.

Purpose of these scripts is to:
  1. Save time in developing Power BI datasets
  2. Apply consistent patterns dataset-to-dataset (say Measures are created to best practice standard, need this to repeat on each model)
